N A Hero's Burden |N|This is a group quest, but some classes may be able to solo it.  If you choose to do it now, head down into the Sundered Shard and kill the lich (72.21, 56.99).  This is also the quest where you pick a faction mid-fight, so be ready to save the gorlock or the tanuki.  If you want to switch factions, just come do this quest again on another day.|
