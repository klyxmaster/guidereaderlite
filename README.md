## Notes
This addon was **written entirely from scratch**, though some design influence came from classic addons such as *TourGuide*.  
It’s my own work, but I’m giving credit where inspiration is due.

## Why I Built This
I created GuideReaderLite partly as a way to teach myself Lua, even if the language feels dated today. At the same time, I noticed there weren’t many strong leveling guides left for the original 3.3.5a era, so I decided to revive the quest routes I had written years ago and give them a proper addon home. I also don’t play retail anymore after twenty years, and with how different modern Lua coding has become, I wasn’t interested in rewriting everything. This project is built purely for private servers, to keep the WotLK experience alive in the way I still enjoy it.

## Disclaimer
This addon is built for educational and nostalgic use on **WotLK 3.3.5a private servers**.  
It is **not affiliated with Blizzard Entertainment** and currently **not designed for retail WoW**.

## TODO:
- **Classes** Currently these are not done, but I do have them in place, I route and test my guide with a priest. But once I am happy with all the new updates I will go back and clean up the classes.   
- **Arrow GPS** NPC's are done and spot on, objectives are W.I.P. Use map for now to locations.
- **TAGS** Some tags are goofy, as I am experimenting with them, but should work for the most part.
- **RETAIL VERSION** YES! I plan on making a retails version of GRL. FREE! Will do this one all the bugs are worked out. And only will be WOTLK only.
